IC
============

IC stands for Invisible Cities. The title pays homage to Italo Calvino's master
piece. IC provides a set of cities that manipulate data (e.g, a city is a place
where people meet and trade, in short, information exchange). Cities are the
drives of the NEXT reconstruction software.

IC was conceived by J.J. Gomez-Cadenas (JJGC) in 2016, as a python-ecosystem
replacement to the previous NEXT software based in C++. The main architects of
IC are JJGC and Jacek Generowicz (JG). The core developer team includes Gonzalo
Martinez (GM), Jose Maria Benlloch (JMB) and Alejandro Botas (AB). The list of
contributors to IC includes: Jose Angel Hernando (JAH), Josh Renner (JR), Paola
Ferrario (PF) and Brais Palmeiro (BP).
