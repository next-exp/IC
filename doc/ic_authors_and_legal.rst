IC
============

IC stands for Invisible Cities. The title pays homage to Italo Calvino's master piece. IC provides a set of cities that manipulate data (e.g, a city is a place where people meet and trade, in short, information exchange). Cities are the drives of the NEXT reconstruction software.

IC is under MIT license.

IC was conceived by J.J. Gomez-Cadenas (JJGC) in 2016, as a python-ecosystem replacement to the previous NEXT software based in C++. The main architects of IC are JJGC and Jacek Generowicz (JG). The core developer team includes Gonzalo Martinez (GM), Jose Maria Benlloch (JMB) and Alejandro Botas (AB). The list of contributors to IC includes: Jose Angel Hernando (JAH), Josh Renner (JR), Paola Ferrario (PF) and Brais Palmeiro (BP).
