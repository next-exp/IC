Imagine this is some real configuration file for some real package.

Home manager makes this file available in your home directory via a symbolic
link to

  $HOME/my-home-manager/eg-rw

This is more flexible than the read-only version:

+ You can tweak its contents without having to rerun `home-manager switch`.
+ External programs can modify this configuration file.

This more flexible, but less safe: third parties may modify your configuration
without you noticing.
