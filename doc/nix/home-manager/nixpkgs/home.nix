  # Sick and tired of making git commits with author email
  # 'Pepito@Pepitos-Macbook-Pro'? Then why not let home-manager take care of
  # configuring Git for you? Adapt the following to your needs:
  programs.git = {
    enable = true;
    lfs.enable = true;
  # Local .gitconfig files may override these settings:
  #   userName = "Fulana Menganez-Perenganez";

  #   aliases = {
  #     lg  = "log --graph --decorate --oneline";
  #     lga = "log --graph --decorate --oneline --all";
  #   };
  };

  # This is how to get home-manager to place your version-controlled
  # configuration files in your home directory. There are two approaches,
  # read-only and read-write. Read the text in `eg-ro` and `eg-rw` for more
  # details. Replace these with your own real-world cases.

  home.file.".example-read-write".source = link ../eg-rw;
  # The previous two lines are just examples, which you can adapt to your own
  # needs. The next line is vital: it ensures that home-manager will be able to
  # find its configuration file (that's the file in which these words are
  # written) in the standard location.
  home.file.".config/nixpkgs".source = link ../nixpkgs;
