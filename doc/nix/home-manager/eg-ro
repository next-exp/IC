Imagine this is some real configuration file for some real package.

Home manager makes this file available in your home directory in read-only form.
The only way to modify it is to change its contents by editing

  $HOME/my-home-manager/eg-ro

followed by

  home-manager switch

Consequently, external programs will be prevented from modifying this
configuration file.

This is very inflexible, but very safe.
