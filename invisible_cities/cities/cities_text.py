diomira = """
Leaving there and proceeding for three days toward the east, you reach Diomira,
a city with sixty silver domes, bronze statues of all the gods, streets paved
with lead, a crystal theater, a golden cock that crows every morning on a
tower. All these beauties will already be familiar to the visitor, who has seen
them also in other cities. But the special quality of this city for the man who
arrives there on a September evening, when the days are growing shorter and the
multicolored lamps are lighted all at once at the doors of the food stalls and
from a terrace a woman's voice cries ooh!, is that he feels envy toward those
who now believe they have once before lived an evening identical to this and
who think they were happy, that time.

isidora = """
When a man rides a long time through wild regions he feels the desire for a
city. Finally he comes to Isidora, a city where the buildings have spiral
staircases encrusted with spiral seashells, where perfect telescopes and
violins are made, where the foreigner hesitating between two women always
encounters a third, where cockfights degenerate into bloody brawls among the
bettors. He was thinking of all these things when he desired a city. Isidora,
therefore, is the city of his dreams: with one difference. The dreamed-of city
contained him as a young man; he arrives at Isidora in his old age. In the
square there is the wall where the old men sit and watch the young go by; he is
seated in a row with them. Desires are already memories.
"""

anastasia = """
At the end of three days, moving southward, you come upon Anastasia, a city
with concentric canals watering it and kites flying over it. I should now list
the wares that can profitably be bought here: agate, onyx, chrysoprase, and
other varieties of chalcedony; I should praise the flesh of the golden pheasant
cooked here over fires of seasoned cherry wood and sprinkled with much sweet
marjoram; and tell of the women I have seen bathing in the pool of a garden and
who sometimes-it is said-invite the stranger to disrobe with them and chase
them in the water. But with all this, I would not be telling you the city's
true essence; for while the description of Anastasia awakens desires one at a
time only to force you to stifle them, when you are in the heart of Anastasia
one morning your desires waken all at once and surround you. The city appears
to you as a whole where no desire is lost and of which you are a part, and
since it enjoys everything you do not enjoy, you can do nothing but inhabit
this desire and be content. Such is the power, sometimes called malignant,
sometimes benign, that Anastasia, the treacherous city, possesses; if for eight
hours a day you work as a cutter of agate, onyx, chrysoprase, your labor which
gives form to desire takes from desire its form, and you believe you are
enjoying Anastasia wholly when you are only its slave.
"""

dorothea = """
There are two ways of describing the city of Dorothea: you can say that four
aluminum towers rise from its walls flanking seven gates with spring-operated
drawbirdges that span the moat whose water feeds four green canals wichi cross
the citiy, dividing it into nine quarters, each with three hundred houses and
seven hundred chimneys [...] or else you can say like the camel driver who took
me there: " I arrived in my first youth, ne morming, many people were hurrying
along the streets towards the market, the women had fine teeth and looked you
straight in the the eye, three soldiers on a platform played the trumpet, and
all around wheels turned and colored banners fluttered in the wind.
