                            Esmeralda
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

From the spanish "esmeralda" (emerald), as first used in the novel
Notre-Dame de Paris (1831) by Victor Hugo.

This city performs three main tasks:
 - Applies a threshold to the hits
 - Applies energy corrections to the hits
 - Finds tracks

This city reads hDSTs produced by Sophronia and produces tracks and
corrected hits. It also produces a summary of the event topology and
copies the kDST from the input to the output file.
The steps performed by Esmeralda are:
  - Apply geometrical and lifetime corrections
  - Fiducialize hits: remove external hits that cannot be corrected
    accurately
  - Apply a high charge threshold to the input hits
    - If this leaves behind a slice with no hits, a fake (NN) hit is
      temporarily created.
  - Merge NN-hits: The NN-hits' energy is reassigned to the closest
    non-NN-hits
  - Voxelizes surviving hits
  - Finds tracks by optimizing the path that connects all voxels
  - Drops low energy voxels in the track extrema
  - Obtains the blobs energy
  - Produces a topology summary of the event
